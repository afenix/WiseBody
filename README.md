WiseBody
========

Website designed using Bootstrap, and modified template.  Created as final exercise for PCS Primer class.  I am brand spanking new as a coder, so please excuse any hiccups.  In the past month I've been learning git, command line, html, and css in my spare time and with guidance from my PCS primer class.  This project is the result of my progress to date.

Features include HTML, CSS styling and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).
